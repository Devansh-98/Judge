	I have taught Devansh Bajpai "Cryptography" and "Software Tools and Technology" in 2018. Strong programming knowledge and grasp on the fundamentals of subjects are necessary for doing well in my courses. He has done well in both of my courses. He is also part of the acedmic portal development team in which I am a supervisor, he has demonstrated remarkable problem solving and development skills in this project. His current contribution reflects his in-depth understanding of Databases and Java API development.
	Given this background, Devansh can easily fit into any research or development group and will hardly require any external training in the aforementioned fields.
Sincerely,
